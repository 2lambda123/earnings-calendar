Notes from the author
=====================
The gcal-boilerplate directory is a copy of the Google API Client starter application.
Look at the README in that directory to install the Google API Client directly if you wish, although this application will run fine even if you don't.

You will need to register for Google's API services and get your own client_secrets.json to replace the stub in gcal-boilerplate, so that you can modify your own calendar.
